## Overview

Agentical is a modern, production-ready framework for building intelligent AI agents and workflows. Built on top of Pydantic AI and FastAPI, it provides a robust foundation for creating scalable agentic systems with comprehensive observability, security, and testing capabilities.

+ 1. FastAPI is the web framework we use to optmize Pydantic AI's agentic framework. This is the foundation of a production grade environement.
+ 2. Not far behind is the deeply integrated Logfire observability platform. We log all events, capture all exceptions.
+ 3. PyTest is the unit test frawmework that guides our Build-to-Test development approach. Every subtask must pass at 95% or greater before development can progress to the next dependent subtask.
+ 4. Taskmaster AI is our project management work horse. 
	+ a. We estimate and update complexity after every subtask. We save all status updates in /devqai/darwin/.taskmaster/reports and all tasks/subtasks in /Users/dionedge/devqai/darwin/.taskmaster/tasks
	+ b. We commit after the completion of every subtask.
	+ c. We determine the critical path of subtasks, reasses after the completion of a subtask, and execute to the critical path. We do this to save time and tokens and to accumulate the least technical debt.
+ 5. We backup our entire environment /Users/dionedge/devqai every night at 2 AM CDT to /Users/dionedge/backups.
+ 6. The ZED IDE Agent and Claude Code Agent verify at the start of a project they have access to the many tools avaible to them (MCP Servers: /devqai/mcp, Knowledge Base:/devqai/ptolemies, Agent Tools: setting.json).
	a. IMPORTANT: Agents should never have to hallucianate or guess when writing code if they have access to tools like `context7` the `ptolemis` konwledge graph but they must use them.
	b. Agentical does not need to build tools when /devqai/mcp and /devqai/ptolemies are available.
+ 7. The SurrealDB serves two distinct independent purposes:
	+ a. The knolwedge base contained and managed by /ptolemies/ that serves the /devqai/ community
	+ b. The application database in Agentical which keeps configs for Agents, Tool, Workflows, and messages, documents, logs while executing Playbooks.

#### Reasoning

Some Agents have the aditional ability to reason when evaluating a problem or overcoming some obstacle. This can be as simple as having more time to think about a problem or objective to using sophisticated mathematics like Bayes Inference, Genetic Algorithm, or Simulations. All of these are available through MCP and Ptolemies.

### Playbooks

Playbooks are a set of instruction consisting of steps for one or more Agents to execute to some condition with one or more Tools in one or more workflows to achieve one or more objectives. The Playbook is the center of this agentic system.

### Critical Issues

+ 1. We must spend sufficient time on the Agent/Tool/Workflow configs.
+ 2. We must deliberately conisder how `Reasoning` will work.
+ 3. We must decide which Agents and Tools we will build.
+ 4. We must try to build a local agent not dependent on an outside LLM (https://github.com/Fosowl/agenticSeek).
+ 5. We must develop at least some number of Playbooks to truly test the environment.
+ 6  We must build a UI interface to showcase our environment (NextJS, Shadn, Tailwind CSS).
+ 7. We must decide which of these, if not all, are MVP.
