## Usage Examples

### Structured Logging
```python
from core.structured_logging import StructuredLogger, CorrelationContext

logger = StructuredLogger("my_component")
correlation = CorrelationContext.generate(user_id="user123")

with logger.correlation_context(correlation):
    logger.log_api_request(
        message="User API request",
        method="POST",
        path="/api/users",
        status_code=201,
        response_time_ms=150.5
    )
```

### Performance Monitoring
```python
from core.performance import PerformanceMonitor

monitor = PerformanceMonitor()

# Record request metrics
monitor.record_request(
    response_time=125.5,
    status_code=200,
    request_size=1024,
    response_size=2048
)

# Get performance summary
summary = monitor.get_performance_summary()
print(f"Average response time: {summary['avg_response_time']}ms")
print(f"Error rate: {summary['error_rate']}%")
```

## Next Steps

Both tasks are complete and ready for production use. The implementation provides:

1. **Comprehensive Observability** - Full request tracing and performance monitoring
2. **Production Performance** - Optimized async patterns and response handling
