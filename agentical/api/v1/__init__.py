Agentical API v1 Module

This module contains version 1 of the Agentical API endpoints,
providing comprehensive REST APIs for agent management, system workflow orchestration,
playbook execution, and system monitoring.

WORKFLOW TYPE CLARIFICATION:
- System Workflows (/workflows/) - Multi-agent orchestration, business processes, external integrations
- Agent Workflows - Internal agent logic patterns (managed via agent configuration APIs)
See docs/workflow_quick_reference.md for detailed differences.

Features:
- Agent Management APIs (CRUD, monitoring, analytics, internal workflow configuration)
- Playbook Management APIs (creation, execution, monitoring)
- System Workflow Management APIs (multi-agent orchestration, business process control)
- System Analytics and Monitoring APIs (workflows, agents, infrastructure)
- Real-time WebSocket connections
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
