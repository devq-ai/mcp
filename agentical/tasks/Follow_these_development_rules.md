## Follow these development rules while working on Tasks and Subtasks:
- Estimate and update complexity after every subtask
- Save all status updates in `/devqai/agentical/tasks/status_updates/
- Save all tasks/subtasks in `/devqai/agentical/tasks/
- Include complexity scores, test count/percentage
- Commit after the completion of every subtask, DO NOT PUSH
- Determine the critical path of subtasks
- Reassess after the completion of a subtask
- Execute to the critical path
- Purpose: Save time and tokens and minimize the probable technical debt
