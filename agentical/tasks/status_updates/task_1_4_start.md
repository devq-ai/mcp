- **Risk Level:** Low
- **Complexity Factors:** Health endpoint design, dependency checking, monitoring integration

## Description
Implement comprehensive health monitoring with dependency checks. Create /health, /readiness, /metrics endpoints, add dependency health checks for external services, and configure monitoring integration with Logfire observability.

## Dependencies
- **Blocking Dependencies:** Task 1.1 ✅ COMPLETED (Core FastAPI Setup)

- **Prerequisites:** FastAPI application foundation, error handling framework, security middleware
- **Required Tools:** FastAPI routing, Pydantic models, Logfire integration, async health checks

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Core Health Endpoints
**Endpoint Structure:**
- `/health` - Basic application health status
- `/readiness` - Application readiness for traffic  
- `/metrics` - Application metrics and statistics
- `/health/detailed` - Comprehensive health with dependency status
- `/health/live` - Kubernetes liveness probe endpoint

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy|degraded|unhealthy",
  "timestamp": "2024-06-10T12:00:00Z",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "uptime": 3600,
  "checks": {
    "database": "healthy",
    "external_services": "healthy",
    "mcp_servers": "healthy"
  },
  "metrics": {
    "requests_total": 1000,
    "errors_total": 5,
    "avg_response_time": 150
  }
}
```

### 2. Dependency Health Checking
**Infrastructure Health Checker Class:**

- **MCP Server Health:** Check operational MCP servers from registry
- **Ptolemies Knowledge Base:** Verify knowledge base accessibility
- **External Services:** API endpoint availability checks
- **File System:** Required directories and permissions
- **Memory & CPU:** System resource utilization

**Health Check Patterns:**
- Async health checks for performance
- Configurable timeout settings
- Circuit breaker patterns for failing services
- Cached health status with TTL
- Graceful degradation handling

### 3. Monitoring Integration
**Logfire Integration:**
- Health check events logging
- Performance metrics tracking
- Error rate monitoring
- Response time histograms
- Service dependency status

**Metrics Collection:**
- Request counters and response times
- Error rates by endpoint and type
- Health check success/failure rates
- System resource utilization
- Custom business metrics

### 4. Kubernetes Health Probes
**Liveness Probe:** `/health/live`
- Simple up/down status check
- Fast response (<100ms)
- No external dependencies
- Memory and basic functionality

**Readiness Probe:** `/readiness`
- Comprehensive dependency checks
- Traffic routing decision
- External service availability
- Database connectivity

**Startup Probe:** `/health/startup`
- Initial application readiness
- Longer timeout for initialization
- Database migration status
- Service discovery completion

### 5. Performance Monitoring
**Response Time Tracking:**
- Endpoint-specific response times
- 95th/99th percentile metrics
- Request duration histograms
- Performance regression detection

**Resource Monitoring:**
- Memory usage patterns
- CPU utilization tracking
- Database connection pool status
- Async task queue metrics
