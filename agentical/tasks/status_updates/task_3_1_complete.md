## Technical Implementation Details

### Phase 1: Enhanced SQLAlchemy Configuration ✅
```python
# Advanced SQLAlchemy configuration with monitoring
class DatabaseManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.started_at = time.time()
        self.query_count = 0
        self.error_count = 0
        self.connection_stats = {
            'sqlalchemy': {'active': 0, 'total': 0},
            'surrealdb': {'active': 0, 'total': 0}
        }

    async def health_check_all(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Comprehensive health check for all database systems."""
        # Validates both SQLAlchemy and SurrealDB connections
        # Returns detailed status for monitoring
```

**Key Enhancements:**
- Async and sync session management
- Connection pool monitoring with detailed statistics
- Slow query detection and logging
- Automatic health check integration
- Environment-based configuration

### Phase 2: Alembic Migration Framework ✅
```bash

alembic/
├── env.py                    # Async-aware environment configuration
├── versions/                 # Migration files directory
└── script.py.mako           # Migration template

# Configuration files
alembic.ini                   # Migration settings with timezone support
```

**Features Implemented:**

### Phase 3: SurrealDB Integration ✅
```python
class SurrealDBManager:
    """Async SurrealDB connection pool manager."""
    
    async def execute_query(self, query: str, params: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None):
        """Execute query with retry logic and monitoring."""
        # Implements connection pooling
        # Retry logic with exponential backoff
        # Performance monitoring and logging
        # Health check integration
```

**Key Features:**
- Connection pooling with configurable limits
- Query execution with timeout and retry logic
- Health monitoring and status reporting
- Graceful degradation when unavailable
- Performance metrics collection

### Phase 4: Database Manager Integration ✅
```python
# Centralized database management
database_manager = DatabaseManager()

async def initialize_database_layer(drop_all: bool = False):
    """Initialize all database systems."""
    await database_manager.initialize_all_databases(drop_all)

async def get_database_health() -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Get comprehensive database health status."""
    return await database_manager.health_check_all()
```
