## Current Foundation Analysis

### âœ… Available from Task 2.1

### Current Logfire Capabilities
```python
# Existing instrumentation from Task 2.1:
logfire.instrument_fastapi(app, capture_headers=True)
logfire.instrument_httpx()
logfire.instrument_sqlalchemy()

# Basic span creation available:
with logfire.span("operation_name", attribute="value"):
    logfire.info("Message", context="data")
```
