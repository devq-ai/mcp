# Task ID: 4
# Title: Set up MCP Server Integration Tests
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a comprehensive integration testing framework for the MCP server to ensure reliable functionality across components and verify correct interaction with external systems.
# Details:
This task involves setting up a robust integration testing framework for the MCP server:

1. Select and configure testing frameworks:
   - Choose appropriate testing libraries (pytest, unittest, etc.)
   - Set up test fixtures and configuration management
   - Implement test database setup/teardown procedures

2. Create test environment configuration:
   - Develop environment variable management for different test scenarios
   - Implement mock services for external dependencies
   - Configure CI/CD pipeline integration for automated test execution

3. Implement core integration test suites:
   - Test FastAPI endpoints and request/response handling
   - Verify agent communication protocols and data exchange
   - Test Ptolemies knowledge base connection and query functionality
   - Validate error handling and recovery mechanisms

4. Develop test data management:
   - Create seed data generation scripts
   - Implement database state reset between tests
   - Design test data isolation to prevent cross-test contamination

5. Implement performance and load testing:
   - Create benchmarks for critical operations
   - Test concurrent request handling
   - Measure and validate response times under various loads

6. Document testing approach:
   - Create comprehensive test documentation
   - Provide examples for adding new tests
   - Establish guidelines for test coverage requirements

# Test Strategy:
The integration test setup can be verified through the following steps:

1. Verify test framework installation and configuration:
   - Confirm all testing dependencies are correctly installed
   - Run a simple smoke test to validate the test environment
   - Check that test configuration can be loaded from environment variables

2. Validate test database setup:
   - Verify test database initialization scripts work correctly
   - Confirm data seeding procedures populate expected test data
   - Test database teardown and cleanup functionality

3. Execute core integration tests:
   - Run tests against FastAPI endpoints and verify correct responses
   - Test agent communication with appropriate mocks
   - Verify Ptolemies knowledge base queries return expected results
   - Confirm error handling tests produce appropriate responses

4. Verify CI/CD integration:
   - Confirm tests run successfully in the CI/CD pipeline
   - Validate test reports are generated correctly
   - Check that test failures properly fail the build

5. Review test coverage:
   - Generate and analyze test coverage reports
   - Verify critical paths are adequately covered
   - Identify and address any coverage gaps

6. Perform code review:
   - Have team members review test implementation
   - Verify tests follow project coding standards
   - Ensure tests are maintainable and well-documented

# Subtasks:
## 1. Configure Testing Framework and Environment [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Select and set up the testing framework with proper configuration for the MCP server integration tests.
### Details:
Choose pytest as the primary testing framework. Create a tests/ directory with proper structure. Set up pytest.ini configuration file with necessary plugins (pytest-asyncio, pytest-cov). Implement conftest.py with shared fixtures for database connections, API clients, and environment setup. Configure environment variable management for different test environments (dev, staging, CI).

## 2. Implement Test Database Management [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create database setup, teardown, and isolation mechanisms for integration tests.
### Details:
Implement database fixtures that create isolated test databases for each test session. Use transaction rollbacks to reset state between tests. Create seed data generation scripts that populate test databases with required initial data. Implement utility functions to verify database state during tests. Set up database migration handling to ensure schema is current before tests run.

## 3. Develop Mock Services for External Dependencies [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create mock implementations of external services and APIs that the MCP server interacts with.
### Details:
Identify all external dependencies (APIs, services, etc.). Implement mock servers using tools like responses, pytest-httpx, or mock-socket depending on the protocol. Create fixture factories that allow tests to configure mock response behaviors. Implement response templating system to easily generate realistic mock data. Set up network isolation to prevent tests from making real external calls.

## 4. Implement Core Integration Test Suites [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create comprehensive test suites for key MCP server components and their interactions.
### Details:
Implement test classes for each major API endpoint group. Create tests for agent communication protocols including connection, authentication, and data exchange. Develop test suites for Ptolemies knowledge base integration focusing on query functionality and data consistency. Implement error handling tests that verify proper recovery mechanisms. Create test utilities for common assertions and test data generation.

## 5. Set Up CI/CD Integration and Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure automated test execution in CI/CD pipeline and create comprehensive test documentation.
### Details:
Configure GitHub Actions workflow for automated test execution on pull requests and merges. Set up test coverage reporting and minimum coverage thresholds. Implement performance benchmarking for critical operations with baseline metrics. Create comprehensive documentation explaining the testing approach, framework usage, and guidelines for adding new tests. Include examples of different test types and patterns to follow.
