# Task ID: 1
# Title: Debug and Stabilize FastAPI Application
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Identify and fix bugs, performance issues, and stability problems in the existing FastAPI application to ensure reliable operation in production environments.
# Details:
This task involves a comprehensive debugging and stabilization effort for the FastAPI application:

1. Set up proper logging throughout the application:
   - Implement structured logging with different severity levels
   - Ensure request/response logging for API endpoints
   - Add contextual information to logs (request IDs, user IDs, etc.)

2. Perform code review and static analysis:
   - Run linters and static analysis tools (pylint, mypy, etc.)
   - Address all warnings and errors identified
   - Review exception handling patterns

3. Implement proper error handling:
   - Create custom exception classes for different error scenarios
   - Implement global exception handlers to return appropriate HTTP responses
   - Ensure all API endpoints have proper error handling

4. Performance optimization:
   - Profile the application to identify bottlenecks
   - Optimize database queries and connection pooling
   - Implement caching where appropriate
   - Review and optimize async/await patterns

5. Add health check endpoints:
   - Create /health endpoint for basic availability checks
   - Implement /readiness endpoint for dependency checks
   - Add /metrics endpoint for monitoring systems

6. Implement rate limiting and throttling:
   - Add rate limiting middleware to prevent abuse
   - Configure appropriate limits based on endpoint sensitivity

7. Enhance request validation:
   - Review and strengthen Pydantic models
   - Add additional validation logic where needed
   - Implement request size limits

8. Fix identified bugs:
   - Systematically address all known issues
   - Create regression tests for each fixed bug

# Test Strategy:
1. Automated Testing:
   - Write comprehensive unit tests for all fixed bugs
   - Implement integration tests for API endpoints
   - Create load tests to verify performance improvements
   - Set up CI pipeline to run tests automatically

2. Manual Testing:
   - Perform exploratory testing to identify edge cases
   - Test error scenarios by deliberately triggering exceptions
   - Verify logging output contains necessary information

3. Performance Verification:
   - Use tools like locust or k6 to perform load testing
   - Establish performance baselines and verify improvements
   - Monitor memory usage during extended test runs

4. Stability Testing:
   - Run the application continuously for 24+ hours under varying load
   - Verify no memory leaks or resource exhaustion occurs
   - Test application restart and recovery scenarios

5. Monitoring Setup:
   - Configure monitoring tools to track application metrics
   - Set up alerts for error rates, response times, and resource usage
   - Verify logs are properly captured and searchable

6. Documentation:
   - Document all fixed issues and their solutions
   - Update API documentation to reflect changes
   - Create runbook for common issues and their resolution
