# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Workflow Engine for Agent Coordination
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Design and implement a workflow engine that orchestrates the execution of tasks across multiple agents, enabling sequential and parallel processing patterns with proper state management.
# Details:
This task involves implementing a comprehensive workflow engine to coordinate agent activities:

1. Design the workflow architecture:
   - Define a workflow specification format (YAML/JSON) for describing agent tasks and their relationships
   - Create data structures for representing workflow states, transitions, and conditions
   - Design patterns for sequential, parallel, and conditional execution paths

2. Implement core workflow components:
   - Develop a workflow parser to interpret workflow definitions
   - Create a workflow scheduler to manage execution timing and dependencies
   - Implement a state manager to track workflow progress and handle persistence
   - Build an event system for workflow transitions and notifications

3. Integrate with existing agent infrastructure:
   - Create interfaces for agents to register with the workflow engine
   - Implement communication channels between the workflow engine and agents
   - Design mechanisms for passing context and data between workflow steps
   - Ensure proper error handling and recovery mechanisms

4. Implement workflow monitoring and control:
   - Create endpoints for starting, stopping, and pausing workflows
   - Develop status reporting mechanisms for active workflows
   - Implement logging for workflow execution events
   - Build visualization tools for workflow status and progress

5. Optimize for performance and reliability:
   - Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed workflow definitions
   - Design for horizontal scalability with multiple workflow engine instances
   - Create persistence mechanisms to survive system restarts
   - Implement timeout handling and dead-agent detection

# Test Strategy:
The workflow engine implementation should be verified through the following testing approach:

1. Unit testing:
   - Test workflow parser with various valid and invalid workflow definitions
   - Verify state transitions function correctly under different conditions
   - Test scheduler logic for proper timing and dependency resolution
   - Validate error handling mechanisms with simulated failures

2. Integration testing:
   - Create test workflows that integrate with actual agent implementations
   - Verify data passing between workflow steps functions correctly
   - Test persistence by interrupting and resuming workflows
   - Validate proper cleanup of resources after workflow completion

3. Performance testing:
   - Measure throughput with varying numbers of concurrent workflows
   - Test memory usage patterns during extended operation
   - Verify scalability with simulated load increases
   - Measure latency of workflow operations under different conditions

4. Functional validation:
   - Create end-to-end test cases for common workflow patterns
   - Verify workflows can properly coordinate multiple agents
   - Test conditional branching based on agent outputs
   - Validate proper handling of timeouts and retries

5. Manual testing:
   - Create a test dashboard to visualize and control test workflows
   - Manually verify workflow visualization accuracy
   - Test administrative controls for workflow management
   - Validate logging and monitoring functionality

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Workflow Specification Format and Core Data Structures [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundational data structures and specification format that will define how workflows are represented in the system.
### Details:
Implement a YAML/JSON-based workflow specification format that includes: task definitions, dependency relationships, execution modes (sequential/parallel), conditional logic, and timeout configurations. Create corresponding internal data structures including WorkflowDefinition, WorkflowTask, WorkflowState, and TransitionCondition classes. Design should support serialization/deserialization for persistence and include validation logic for workflow definitions.

## 2. Implement Workflow Parser and State Manager [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Build the components responsible for interpreting workflow definitions and managing workflow state throughout execution.
### Details:
Develop a WorkflowParser that converts specification files into executable workflow objects. Implement a StateManager that tracks the current state of all workflow instances, handles state transitions, and provides persistence capabilities. Include functionality for serializing workflow state to a database or file system. Implement recovery mechanisms to restore workflow state after system interruptions.

## 3. Build Workflow Scheduler and Execution Engine [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Create the core execution components that orchestrate task scheduling and execution across multiple agents.
### Details:
Implement a WorkflowScheduler that manages task dependencies and determines when tasks are ready for execution. Build an ExecutionEngine that dispatches tasks to appropriate agents, handles parallel execution patterns, and manages execution timeouts. Implement a queueing system for pending tasks and develop logic for handling conditional execution paths based on task outcomes. Create retry mechanisms for failed tasks with configurable retry policies.

## 4. Develop Agent Integration Interfaces and Communication Channels [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.3
### Description: Create the interfaces and communication mechanisms that allow agents to participate in workflows.
### Details:
Implement agent registration interfaces that allow agents to advertise their capabilities to the workflow engine. Create communication channels (e.g., message queues, gRPC, REST) for task assignment and result reporting. Develop context-passing mechanisms to share data between workflow steps and agents. Implement dead-agent detection with health check protocols and design fallback strategies for agent failures.

## 5. Implement Workflow Control API and Monitoring Dashboard [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.4
### Description: Build the external interfaces for controlling workflows and monitoring their execution status.
### Details:
Develop a REST API for workflow management with endpoints for creating, starting, stopping, pausing, and resuming workflows. Implement comprehensive logging throughout the workflow engine with structured log formats. Create a real-time monitoring system that tracks workflow progress, agent status, and system performance metrics. Build a web-based dashboard for visualizing active workflows, execution history, and performance statistics. Implement alerting for workflow failures or delays.
