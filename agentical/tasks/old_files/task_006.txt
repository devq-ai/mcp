# Task ID: 6
# Title: Create Test Framework Infrastructure with PyTest and Logfire
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 1, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement a comprehensive test framework using PyTest for test organization and execution, integrated with Logfire for advanced logging and monitoring capabilities.
# Details:
1. Set up PyTest environment:
   - Install PyTest and necessary plugins (pytest-cov for coverage, pytest-xdist for parallel execution)
   - Configure pytest.ini file with project-specific settings

2. Implement test directory structure:
   - Create a 'tests' directory at the project root
   - Set up subdirectories for unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
   - Implement test discovery patterns in pytest.ini

3. Integrate Logfire:
   - Install Logfire SDK
   - Configure Logfire connection settings (API key, project ID)
   - Implement a custom PyTest plugin to send test results and logs to Logfire

4. Create base test classes:
   - Implement BaseTest class with common setup and teardown methods
   - Create separate base classes for unit, integration, and e2e tests

5. Implement test utilities:
   - Develop mock object generators for common dependencies
   - Create test data factories using libraries like Faker
   - Implement helper functions for common test operations

6. Set up test database management:
   - Implement database setup and teardown fixtures
   - Use tools like SQLAlchemy for database interactions in tests

7. Configure CI/CD integration:
   - Set up GitHub Actions or similar CI tool to run tests on each commit
   - Configure test result reporting and code coverage analysis

8. Implement test parameterization:
   - Use PyTest's parameterize feature for data-driven tests
   - Create custom markers for test categorization

9. Establish best practices documentation:
   - Write guidelines for writing effective tests
   - Document naming conventions and test organization principles

10. Implement performance testing infrastructure:
    - Integrate tools like Locust for load testing
    - Set up performance benchmarks and thresholds

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify PyTest installation and configuration:
   - Run 'pytest --version' to confirm installation
   - Check that pytest.ini is correctly parsed by running 'pytest --help'

2. Test directory structure and discovery:
   - Run PyTest without arguments and confirm all tests are discovered
   - Verify that tests in different subdirectories (unit, integration, e2e) are correctly identified

3. Validate Logfire integration:
   - Run a sample test and check Logfire dashboard for received logs
   - Verify that test results (pass/fail) are correctly reported to Logfire

4. Assess base test classes:
   - Write sample tests inheriting from each base class
   - Confirm that setup and teardown methods are called as expected

5. Evaluate test utilities:
   - Write tests using mock objects and verify correct behavior
   - Confirm that test data factories generate valid and diverse data

6. Check test database management:
   - Run tests that interact with the database and verify proper setup/teardown
   - Confirm that test databases are isolated from production data

7. Verify CI/CD integration:
   - Push a commit to the repository and confirm that tests are automatically run
   - Check that test results and code coverage reports are generated

8. Test parameterization:
   - Create parameterized tests and verify all variations are executed
   - Confirm that custom markers correctly categorize tests

9. Review documentation:
   - Ensure all team members can access and understand the best practices documentation
   - Verify that new tests adhere to the established conventions

10. Validate performance testing setup:
    - Run a Locust test and confirm results are captured
    - Verify that performance benchmarks are correctly measured and reported

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up PyTest Environment and Directory Structure [in-progress]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install PyTest with necessary plugins and establish the test directory structure for the project.
### Details:
Install pytest, pytest-cov, and pytest-xdist using pip. Create a pytest.ini file at the project root with configuration for test discovery, coverage reporting, and parallel execution. Create a 'tests' directory with subdirectories for unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. Add __init__.py files to ensure proper package discovery. Configure test discovery patterns in pytest.ini to recognize tests in all subdirectories.

## 2. Integrate Logfire SDK with Custom PyTest Plugin [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Install and configure Logfire SDK, then create a custom PyTest plugin to send test results and logs to Logfire.
### Details:
Install Logfire SDK using pip. Create a configuration file for Logfire connection settings (API key, project ID). Implement a custom PyTest plugin (conftest.py) that hooks into PyTest's event system to capture test execution events and send them to Logfire. Implement hooks for test start, test completion, test failure, and session completion. Add configuration options to enable/disable Logfire reporting.

## 3. Implement Base Test Classes and Fixtures [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Create base test classes with common setup/teardown methods and implement database management fixtures.
### Details:
Create a BaseTest class with common setup and teardown methods. Implement specialized base classes for unit, integration, and e2e tests that inherit from BaseTest. Add fixtures for database setup and teardown in conftest.py. Implement transaction management to ensure test isolation. Create fixtures for common dependencies and test resources. Add documentation for each base class and fixture.

## 4. Develop Test Utilities and Data Factories [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3
### Description: Create utility functions and data factories to support efficient test writing.
### Details:
Install Faker library for generating test data. Create factory classes for generating test entities with realistic data. Implement mock object generators for common dependencies using unittest.mock or pytest-mock. Develop helper functions for common test operations like authentication, API calls, and data validation. Create utilities for test data cleanup. Organize utilities in a dedicated module within the tests directory.

## 5. Configure CI/CD Integration and Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2, 6.3, 6.4
### Description: Set up CI/CD pipeline integration for automated test execution and create comprehensive testing documentation.
### Details:
Configure GitHub Actions (or similar CI tool) to run tests on each commit. Set up workflows for different test types (unit, integration, e2e). Configure test result reporting and code coverage analysis with badges for the repository. Implement test parameterization using PyTest's parameterize feature. Create custom markers for test categorization. Write comprehensive documentation on test framework usage, best practices, naming conventions, and organization principles. Include examples of different test types.
