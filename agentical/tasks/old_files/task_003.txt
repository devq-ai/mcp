# Task ID: 3
# Title: Establish Reliable Connection to Ptolemies Knowledge Base
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a robust and secure connection mechanism to the Ptolemies knowledge base, enabling agents to query, retrieve, and potentially update information stored in the knowledge repository.
# Details:
This task involves establishing a reliable connection to the Ptolemies knowledge base:

1. Research and select appropriate connection method:
   - Evaluate available APIs or interfaces for the Ptolemies knowledge base
   - Determine authentication requirements (API keys, OAuth, etc.)
   - Assess rate limiting and usage constraints

2. Implement connection module:
   - Create a dedicated connection class/module that handles all knowledge base interactions
   - Implement proper connection pooling to optimize performance
   - Add robust error handling for connection failures, timeouts, and API errors
   - Implement automatic retry mechanisms with exponential backoff

3. Design and implement query interface:
   - Create standardized methods for common query patterns
   - Implement parameterized queries to prevent injection attacks
   - Add result caching for frequently accessed data
   - Develop pagination handling for large result sets

4. Security considerations:
   - Securely store and manage authentication credentials
   - Implement proper logging (without sensitive data)
   - Add request signing if required by the knowledge base
   - Consider implementing connection encryption if not handled by the API

5. Performance optimization:
   - Implement connection pooling
   - Add asynchronous query capabilities
   - Consider implementing a local cache for frequently accessed data
   - Add metrics collection for monitoring connection performance

6. Integration with agent system:
   - Create clear interfaces for agents to access the knowledge base
   - Implement proper abstraction to hide connection details from agents
   - Add documentation for agent developers on how to use the knowledge base connection

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit testing:
   - Create mock responses for the Ptolemies knowledge base API
   - Test connection establishment with various network conditions
   - Verify error handling for different failure scenarios
   - Test authentication and credential management
   - Validate query construction and parameter handling

2. Integration testing:
   - Test actual connections to development/staging instance of Ptolemies knowledge base
   - Verify data retrieval matches expected formats
   - Test performance under load with multiple concurrent connections
   - Validate connection pooling behavior

3. Security testing:
   - Audit credential handling and storage
   - Verify proper encryption of sensitive data
   - Test for potential injection vulnerabilities in query construction
   - Validate proper error handling without information leakage

4. Agent integration testing:
   - Create test agent that uses the knowledge base connection
   - Verify agent can successfully retrieve and use knowledge base data
   - Test error propagation and handling within agent context

5. Performance benchmarking:
   - Measure query response times under various conditions
   - Test connection establishment overhead
   - Evaluate caching effectiveness
   - Measure resource utilization (memory, CPU) during active use

# Subtasks:
## 1. Research and Configure Knowledge Base Connection Parameters [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Research the Ptolemies knowledge base API documentation, identify authentication methods, and configure necessary connection parameters.
### Details:
Examine the Ptolemies API documentation to determine available endpoints, authentication requirements (API keys, OAuth, etc.), rate limits, and usage constraints. Create a configuration module that stores connection parameters securely. Document the findings in a technical specification that outlines the connection strategy, including authentication flow, endpoint structure, and expected response formats.

## 2. Implement Core Connection Module with Error Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Develop a robust connection module that handles authentication, connection pooling, and implements comprehensive error handling.
### Details:
Create a ConnectionManager class that handles establishing and maintaining connections to the Ptolemies knowledge base. Implement connection pooling to optimize performance. Add robust error handling for various failure scenarios including network issues, authentication failures, and API errors. Implement automatic retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for transient failures. Ensure proper resource cleanup on connection termination.

## 3. Design and Implement Query Interface with Security Features [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Create a standardized query interface with parameterized queries, result pagination, and security measures to prevent injection attacks.
### Details:
Develop a QueryBuilder class that constructs properly formatted and sanitized queries. Implement parameterized queries to prevent injection attacks.

Ensure all queries are properly logged without including sensitive data.

## 4. Implement Caching and Performance Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Add caching mechanisms and performance optimizations to improve response times and reduce load on the knowledge base.
### Details:
Implement a two-level caching system: an in-memory cache for frequently accessed data and a persistent cache for larger datasets. Add cache invalidation strategies based on time-to-live and explicit invalidation events. Implement asynchronous query capabilities for non-blocking operations. Add metrics collection for monitoring connection and query performance. Optimize connection reuse patterns to minimize resource consumption.

## 5. Create Agent Integration Layer and Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.4
### Description: Develop an abstraction layer for agents to interact with the knowledge base and create comprehensive documentation for agent developers.
### Details:
Design and implement a KnowledgeBaseClient class that provides a clean, high-level API for agents to query the knowledge base. Abstract away connection details and complex query construction. Implement proper error handling that provides meaningful feedback to agents. Create comprehensive documentation including usage examples, common patterns, error handling guidance, and performance best practices. Add integration tests that demonstrate end-to-end functionality.
