- `shadcn`     - React component library integration
- `stripe`     - Payment processing integration

**Specialized Solvers**

- `solver-z3`     - Z3 theorem prover for formal verification
- `solver-pysat`  - Boolean satisfiability problem solver
- `solver-mzn`    - MiniZinc constraint satisfaction solver

**Database & Infrastructure**

- `surrealdb`  - Multi-model database operations with graph capabilities
- `memory`     - Persistent memory management with contextual recall
- `registry`   - Official MCP server registry and discovery

**Key Capabilities**

- Multi-modal  - Handle text, code, images, and data
- Database     - SurrealDB, Redis, Neo4j support
- AI/ML Tools  - Multiple LLM providers and specialized analysis
- Web & Tools  - Scraping, browser automation, API integration
- Development  - Full-stack development with testing and deployment tools

### Tool Access Configuration

**`.claude/settings.local.json`**

- Enables MCP server auto-discovery: "enableAllProjectMcpServers": true
- Sets permissions: Bash command allowlist for security
- Does NOT define which MCP servers to load - just enables discovery

**`CLAUDE.md`**

- Documentation only - describes what should be available
- Reference specification - not executable configuration
- Tool inventory - comprehensive list of intended capabilities

**`mcp/mcp-servers.json`**

- Actual MCP server definitions - the authoritative configuration
- Executable specifications - commands, arguments, environment variables
- Real server registry - what Claude Code actually loads

**How It Works Together**

1. Claude Code reads `mcp-servers.json` for actual MCP server definitions
2. `settings.local.json` enables the auto-discovery of those servers
3. `CLAUDE.md` documents what should be available (alignment reference)

**Built-in Tools vs MCP Tools**

- Built-in tools (`task`, `bash`, `glob`, etc.) are always available - no configuration needed
- MCP tools require the configuration chain above to be accessible

## Current Status

✅ All three files are aligned after our standardization work
✅ MCP servers are configured and ready to use
✅ Built-in tools work immediately regardless of configuration

The capabilities are accessible through this configuration chain, but `mcp-servers.json` is the actual enabler while the others provide discovery and documentation.

### Zed Editor Configuration (`.zed/settings.json`)

- IDE-specific: Configures Zed editor behavior
- Development environment: Terminal, formatting, LSP, themes
- Local MCP integration: Direct MCP server configuration for Zed's AI features
- Project environment: Sets up PYTHONPATH, working directories, shell initialization

### Claude Code Configuration

- AI assistant-specific: Configures Claude Code's tool access
- MCP server registry: Centralized server definitions
- Permission system: Security controls for tool usage

### Environment Variables

- Zed: Sets basic env vars in terminal
- Claude: Uses comprehensive `.env` files with 94+ variables
- Overlap: Both reference MCP paths and database configs

### MCP Server Definitions

- Zed: Defines `mcpServers` for editor AI features
- Claude: Uses `mcp-servers.json` for 18+ comprehensive servers
- Different: Zed has 1 server (dart), Claude has 18+ servers

### File Structure Integration

devqai/
├── `.zed/settings.json`           # Zed editor configuration
├── `.claude/settings.local.json`  # Claude Code permissions
├── `CLAUDE.md`                    # Claude Code documentation
├── `mcp/mcp-servers.json`         # Claude Code MCP servers
└── `.env`                         # Master environment (both can use)

### Relationship Summary

- Independent systems with different purposes
- Zed: Editor/IDE configuration for development workflow
- Claude: AI assistant tool access and capabilities
- Shared: Environment variables and project paths
- Complementary: Both can leverage the unified `.env` configuration

The Zed configuration enhances the development environment, while the Claude configuration enables AI-powered assistance tools. The Zed terminal configuration works perfectly when properly sourced, providing enhanced development commands and proper environment variables for the DevQ.ai ecosystem.  Zed is running with multiple MCP servers already loaded.
